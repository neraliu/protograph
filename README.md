# Protograph

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/protograph/protograph.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/protograph/protograph)

Protograph is a collection of sequence diagrams of various protocols.

Protograph generations requires protographer and LaTeX.

Project structure:

1. Directory `yaml` contains the protocol description.
2. Directory `tex` contains the TeX and PDF file, generated by Travis CI build, and used by https://protograph.github.io.

Installing protographer and latex docker image:
```
make prepare
```

Generating protograph:
```
make all
```

Please see https://github.com/protograph/protographer/blob/master/yaml/helloworld.yaml and https://github.com/protograph/protographer/blob/master/tex/helloworld.pdf to get a taste of how the YAML-to-PDF conversion works.
